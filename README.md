# heig-labs
A web app for reviewing students projects

## Running the app

2. Run `yarn install` to install all the project dependencies

3. Then, hit `yarn dev` to start the server in development mode.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

The server will restart when you make edits.


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles the project in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

As the server is written in ES6, this command uses webpack to compile the project to ES5.
